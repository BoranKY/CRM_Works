# CRM Study: RFM and BG-BND and Gamma-Gamma Models

In this repository, we conducted studies on customer relationship management (CRM), specifically focusing on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis, BG-BND, and Gamma-Gamma models. These studies were performed on two different datasets.

## Description
The aim of this study is to analyze customer behavior and purchase patterns using RFM analysis and advanced statistical models such as BG-BND and Gamma-Gamma. 

## Datasets
Two distinct datasets were used in this study. Unfortunately, due to data privacy concerns, we are unable to provide access to these datasets.

## Models
1. **RFM Analysis**: Utilizing the RFM framework to segment customers based on their recent purchases, frequency of purchases, and monetary value.
2. **BG-BND Model**: Bayesian Gaussian and Beta-Negative Binomial Distribution model for customer lifetime value prediction and segmentation.
3. **Gamma-Gamma Model**: An extension of the Gamma-Gamma submodel within the Pareto/NBD framework, used for estimating future transactions and customer lifetime value for non-contractual business settings.

## Usage
The code and notebooks provided in this repository offer insights into implementing RFM analysis and the BG-BND and Gamma-Gamma models for customer relationship management. Please note that you will need to use your own datasets to replicate these studies.
